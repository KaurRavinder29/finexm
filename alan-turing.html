<h2>Family</h2>
<img src="a1.jpg" alt="alan turing" align="center">
<p>Turing was born in Maida Vale, London,[2] while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at Chhatrapur, Bihar and Orissa Province, in British India.[20][21] Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney 1881–1976),[2] daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.[22]

Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale,[23] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[24][25] later the Colonnade Hotel.[20][26] Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).[27]

Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's childhood years Turing's parents travelled between Hastings in England[28] and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.[29] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.[30]

Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.[31] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque</p>

<h2>School</h2>
<p>Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.

Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).[33] In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain, but he was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.[34]

Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school".[35] Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit</p>

<h2>Achievements</h2>
<img src="a2.jpg" alt="avhievements" align="center">
<p>He designed the programming of the world's first commercial computer - Whilst at the University of Manchester, Alan Turing designed the programming system of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available electronic digital computer.
He is the father of ArtificiaI Intelligence - Alan Turing is generally regarded as the pioneer of Artificial Intelligence. He believed that computers would be able to learn and devised the Turing Test, which would text whether a computer was really intelligent. No computer has passed the test, as yet.
Alan was awarded an OBE for his wartime services - He was awarded the OBE in 1945 for services to the country in wartime, despite the fact that most of what he did would not be made public for another 30 years.
He was the inventor of the Turing Machine - In 1935, Alan Turing invented a device which is now referred to as the Turing Machine. To this day, all stored-programme digital computers are modelled on this invention.
He was integral to the building of The Bombe. - Although Polish scientists had previously invented a device known as a 'Bomba', Alan took their early versions and developed it into an electro-mechanical machine which greatly helped in the breaking of the Enigma code used by the German forces.
His work enabled the Enigma to be decoded - By early 1942, the team at Bletchley Park were decoding up to 39,000 Enigma messages a month. Eventually this number rose to 84,000 or about two messages decoded every minute.
Alan Turing's war work is believed to have shortened the war - Many people, including Winston Churchill, claimed that Alan Turing's work shortened the Second World War by at least two years.
Alan was a member of the team which decoded the 'Fish' cipher - The 'Fish' cipher which was used towards the end of the war by the German High Command to transmit messages between Hitler and senior officers in the field.</p>
